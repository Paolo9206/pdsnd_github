### Project Title
Explore the US bikeshare data!

### Description
This program allows us to view and understand all the data relating to the bikeshare company through the use of analysis filters such as the cities where the company works, the most common trips, time of use and also allows us to understand our customers, their age, their gender and many other useful information in order to improve our future marketing strategies.

### Files used
In order to make the program work properly, we need the csv files provided by the company for each city (Chicago.csv, New York City.csv, Washington.csv). These files contain a lot of information that can be analyzed and studied.

### Credits
It's important to give proper credit. Add links to any repo that inspired you or blogposts you consulted.
